# svisbm
This is a Python package for stochastic variational inference in weighted and unweighted stochastic blockmodels, optimized for large graphs. The package leverages sparse arrays to load graphs efficiently, ensuring they fit into memory. The update functions are heavily vectorized to maximize efficiency.
